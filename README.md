# X-Mix-Drix

In this project I converted my first HTML coding exercise into a React project. This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game (aka X-Mix-Drix) and the rules are pretty straight forward.
I didn't focus on the graphics as I just wanted to practice my knowledge in Class Components vs Functional Components, and I had a lot of fun while doing that!
