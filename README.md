# X-Mix-Drix

#### In this project I converted my first HTML coding exercise into a React project. 
#### This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game (aka X-Mix-Drix), and the rules are pretty straight forward.
#### I didn't focus on the graphics as I just wanted to practice my knowledge in:
##### 👉 Class Components vs Functional Components
##### 👉 Immutability and retrieving game's history
##### 👉 Planning a well organized hierarchy

## Plus I had a lot of fun doing that 🤭🙃🤭!
